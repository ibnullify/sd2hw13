      <h1>Distance vs. Recession Velocity Graph</h1>
      <p>
        In 1929, Edward Hubble gathered data on celestial objects, taking down their distance (in megaparsecs) from the earth, and their recession velocity in km/s. The goal was to gain some knowledge on the universe and how it was created, and his findings proved to be revolutionary! If you'd like to see the data visit this link: <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/DASL/Datafiles/Hubble.html">Hubble data!</a>
